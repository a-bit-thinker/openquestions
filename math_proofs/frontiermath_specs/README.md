# FrontierMath 14 problems as programming-language specifications

This directory expresses each FrontierMath open problem as a software-oriented spec:

- `inputs` and domain constraints,
- `claim` in logic-like form,
- `certificate` structure,
- `verifier` signature,
- and a score for iterative proof search.

## Scoring rubric: "iterative proof likelihood"

Score from **1 to 10** for how likely a Ralph/Codex loop can make meaningful progress through repeated technique changes.

- **9-10**: Strong for computational search + exact certificate checking.
- **6-8**: Can do substantial computational progress, but full proof likely needs deep theory.
- **3-5**: Programming helps with experiments/examples; theorem-level proof still mostly human/formal-method heavy.
- **1-2**: Computation has limited leverage on full claim.

## About "unprovable"

A loop can search for proofs/disproofs and detect practical limitations, but **cannot generally decide unprovability** for arbitrary statements. Any "unprovable" conclusion should be treated as a meta-mathematical theorem requiring a separate formal framework.
